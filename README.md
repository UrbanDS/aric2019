### Background

The advancements in sensor technology and ubiquity of connected devices has enabled the generation of large volumes of disparate, dynamic and geographically-distributed data both by scientific communities and citizens. The socio-technological innovations motivate the concept of smart and connected cities. A smart city is forward-looking and progressive and has the potential to provide a higher-quality of life. A resilient city can preserve its characteristics, activities and bounce back to its previous stage in the face of an emergency while meeting the daily needs of its citizens.  

The discussions about making cities intelligent and resilient are occurring on two parallel planes. The challenge is to plan and design intelligent cities under the framework of resilience so that online and real-time knowledge discovery from dynamic data streams could be used in conjunction with static data sets to help practitioners and researchers with their policy decisions. While current developments in data science and artificial intelligence has enabled real-time analytics of online and static data sets, the issue of modeling urban plans to ensure an intelligent city that is also resilient need to be well understood to maximize the benefits of connected technologies. Research should also focus on developing real-time analytics to allow edge computing to occur at the source of data to reduce latency with decision-making and enhance resiliency. Visualization techniques also need to be developed to allow public participation not only in data collection, but also in analytics and decision-making efforts to reduce error and uncertainties. The advantages of using high performance and cloud computing, augmented and virtual reality needs to be understood to help with modeling urban areas that are both intelligent and resilient.

### Objective

Given the increasing focus on both intelligent and resilient cities, this 2nd International Workshop on Advances in Resilient and Intelligent Cities (ARIC 2019) is timely. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers, practitioners and academicians to address the challenges of integrating computation, geospatial and urban sciences in building intelligent and resilient cities. The focus of this workshop is to provide a platform to discuss research areas and issues in modeling urban design by considering sensor technology, edge computing, visualization, modeling and simulation, advanced data analytics. With a focus on edge computing, knowledge discovery, artificial intelligence, and real-time analytics, this workshop fits the general theme of ACM SIGSPATIAL.
 
Examples of topics for workshop papers include but not limited to:

- Analytics to integrate heterogenous spatio-temporal data for prediction, detection of anomalies and unusual patterns
- Real-time analytics of dynamic and distributed data
- Edge and distributed computing to mine information from ubiquitous data about cyber-physical systems
- Human dynamics in the Age of Smart/Intelligent Systems
- Spatial social network analytics in the built environment
- Theoretical and practical applications of Internet of Things in urban settings 
- Visualizing urban areas and optimal locations of sensors for urban resilience
- Urban mobility data management and visualization
- Using augmented reality, simulations and 3D-geovisualization for urban planning and to enhance stakeholder experience through collective intelligence
- Case studies of successful deployment of smart and resilient cities
- Policies and theoretical framework needed for successful deployment of intelligent and resilient cities
- Existing state-of-the-art and future directions to integrating social and cyber-physical systems to achieve both smart and resilient cities


### Call for Papers

This 2nd International workshop on Advances in Resilient and Intelligent Cities is designed to be a one-day event that will include two keynotes (one in the morning and one in the afternoon), individual paper presentations, and concluding panel discussion of presenters. The following submission types are invited for this workshop:

- Full research paper: 8-10 pages
- Short research paper or application demo paper: 4 pages
- Vision or statement paper: 2 pages

Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available
at [http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template).
  
<a href="https://easychair.org/account/signin?l=ykXVc077LRLMXWQTTxp0aa" class="button">Submit a Paper</a>

Full research papers should present a specific problem or topic and discuss methodology and findings along with future research directions. Short research papers should demonstrate existing methods, toolkits, and best practices for building intelligent and resilient cities. Vision papers should be more situational in their coverage and focus on future directions while identifying gaps and challenges for designing intelligent cities under the resilient framework by addressing existing policy, sociological, and technological challenges. All submitted papers will be peer-reviewed to ensure the quality and clarity of the research.
