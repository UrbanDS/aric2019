### Background

The advancements in sensor technology and ubiquity of connected devices has enabled the generation of large
volumes of disparate, dynamic and geographically-distributed data both by scientific communities and citizens. The
socio-technological innovations motivate the concept of smart and connected cities. A smart city is forward-looking
and progressive and has the potential to provide a higher-quality of life. A resilient city can preserve its
characteristics, activities and bounce back to its previous stage in the face of an emergency while meeting the daily
needs of its citizens.

The discussions about making cities intelligent and resilient are occurring on two parallel planes. The challenge is
to plan and design intelligent cities under the framework of resilience so that online and real-time knowledge
discovery from dynamic data streams could be used in conjunction with static data sets to help practitioners and
researchers with their policy decisions. While current developments in data science and artificial intelligence has
enabled real-time analytics of online and static data sets, the issue of modeling urban plans to ensure an intelligent
city that is also resilient need to be well understood to maximize the benefits of connected technologies. Research
should also focus on developing real-time analytics to allow edge computing to occur at the source of data to
reduce latency with decision-making and enhance resiliency. Visualization techniques also need to be developed to
allow public participation not only in data collection, but also in analytics and decision-making efforts to reduce
error and uncertainties. The advantages of using high performance and cloud computing, augmented and virtual
reality needs to be understood to help with modeling urban areas that are both intelligent and resilient.

### Objective

Given the increasing focus on both intelligent and resilient cities, this 1 International Workshop on Advances in
Resilient and Intelligent Cities (ARIC 2018) is timely. The purpose of this workshop is to bring together researchers,
practitioners and academicians to address the challenges of integrating computation, geospatial and urban
sciences in building intelligent and resilient cities. The focus of this workshop is to provide a platform to discuss
research areas and issues in modeling urban design by considering sensor technology, edge computing,
visualization, modeling and simulation, advanced data analytics. With a focus on edge computing, knowledge
discovery, artificial intelligence, and real-time analytics, this workshop fits the general theme of ACM SIGSPATIAL.

Examples of topics for workshop papers include but not limited to:

- Analytics to integrate heterogenous spatio-temporal data for prediction, detection of anomalies and unusual
patterns
- Real-time analytics of dynamic and distributed data
- Edge and distributed computing to mine information from ubiquitous data about cyber-physical systems
- Theoretical and practical applications of Internet of Things in urban settings
- Visualizing urban areas and optimal locations of sensors for urban resilience
- Using augmented reality, simulations and 3D-geovisualization for urban planning and to enhance stakeholder
experience through collective intelligence
- Case studies of successful deployment of smart and resilient cities
- Policies and theoretical framework needed for successful deployment of intelligent and resilient cities
- Existing state-of-the-art and future directions to integrating social and cyber-physical systems to achieve both
smart and resilient cities

### Deadlines

This 1 International workshop on Advances in Resilient and Intelligent Cities is designed to be a one-day event
that will include two keynotes (one in the morning and one in the afternoon), individual paper presentations, and
concluding panel discussion of presenters. The following submission types are invited for this workshop:

- Full research paper: 8-10 pages
- Short research paper or application demo paper: 4 pages
- Vision or statement paper: 2 pages

Manuscripts should be submitted in PDF format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available
at http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template.
