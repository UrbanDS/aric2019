You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/zhawhjw/Website/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Background

The advancements in sensor technology and ubiquity of connected devices has enabled the generation of large
volumes of disparate, dynamic and geographically-distributed data both by scientific communities and citizens. The
socio-technological innovations motivate the concept of smart and connected cities. A smart city is forward-looking
and progressive and has the potential to provide a higher-quality of life. A resilient city can preserve its
characteristics, activities and bounce back to its previous stage in the face of an emergency while meeting the daily
needs of its citizens.

The discussions about making cities intelligent and resilient are occurring on two parallel planes. The challenge is
to plan and design intelligent cities under the framework of resilience so that online and real-time knowledge
discovery from dynamic data streams could be used in conjunction with static data sets to help practitioners and
researchers with their policy decisions. While current developments in data science and artificial intelligence has
enabled real-time analytics of online and static data sets, the issue of modeling urban plans to ensure an intelligent
city that is also resilient need to be well understood to maximize the benefits of connected technologies. Research
should also focus on developing real-time analytics to allow edge computing to occur at the source of data to
reduce latency with decision-making and enhance resiliency. Visualization techniques also need to be developed to
allow public participation not only in data collection, but also in analytics and decision-making efforts to reduce
error and uncertainties. The advantages of using high performance and cloud computing, augmented and virtual
reality needs to be understood to help with modeling urban areas that are both intelligent and resilient.

### Objective

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/zhawhjw/Website/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
